## Linear Mixed-Effects Model

1. MCEM(Monte-carlo EM) algorithm for inference of the variance component and performance investigation. </br>
2. Model Selection via a modified BIC criterion incorporating effective sample size for fixed effects and random effects separately. </br>
3. Improved Sumca(Simple, Unified Monte-carlo Assisted) estimation of MSPE of the variance components. </br>
