## Generalized Linear Model Fitting for Student Performance Dataset:
The project for Generalized Linear Model with Instructor Prof.Hans-Georg Mueller
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance
1. Fit a logistic regression model with Group-Lasso Penalty to extract important factors related to exam failure.
Choose the optimal amount of penalty via LOOCV(leave-one-out cross validation) and AUPR(Area Under Precision-recall Curve)
2. Apply PCA on students' grade in multiple stages(2 midterms, 1 finals)
